# HTB AI (10.10.10.144) MACHINE WRITE-UP

- This was a really fun box and my first attempt at reverse engineering. I did a lot of research and sleepless nights. Finally it paid off. Without further ado, lets jump in.

## PART 1 : INITIAL RECON

- As usually we'll begin with our nmap using defult scripts and enumerate versions.

```console
:~/CTF/HTB/boxes/RE# nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/re 10.10.10.144
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-02-13 05:07 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.144
Host is up (0.18s latency).

```
- We have two ports open:

    * Port 80 : Http

        * It's banner tells us its Windows box running __IIS__ version __httpd 10.0__ which is most likely a [windows server 2016](https://port135.com/2015/07/24/a-summary-of-iis-versions/) box

        * It is also leaking a title __reblog.htb__ which could be a potential host name hence I will add that to the __/etc/hosts__

    * Port 445 : SMB

        *  We have a *clock-skew of 1h06m32s* so if we are to do any form of time sensitive attacks such as kerberos we will have to sync our times.

## PART 2 : PORT ENUMERATION

### TCP PORT 80 (http)

 - Lets head over to the website and check it out.

- Visiting [10.10.10.144](http://10.10.10.144) its a redirect to _reblog.htb_

![redirect](./screenshots/2_RE/redirect.png)

- When you click on the redirect, our box doesn't know how to get there. So lets create the host entry for this box.

- Now we go back to firefox and reload page we get:

![reblog.htb](./screenshots/2_RE/reblog.png)

- Checking out the page source to see what this page is created in, whether joomla or wordpress.

- In the source, I see references to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is a static site generator. That suggests it’s likely not exploitable.

    *fUN FACT: This page you are viewing is also created with jekyll*

- The first article contains hints that there are scripts running on the box and to look for user interaction to move between users.

- The second introduces Ghidra, a tool that was released by NSA something that I will exploit later.

- The third references the JDWP Ghidra exploit that was quite famous. This is a red herring, as the Ghidra on this box isn’t running in debug mode. The article even says that no one should run in debug mode.

- The fourth article is a reference to a blog post about using yara to examine macros in Libre Office. It hints that Libre Office is at use here. It also shows how the box’s owner is using yara to filter out uninteresting documents.

- The fifth article talks about how the organization may be blind to techniques in the DOSfuscation and Invoke-Obfuscation research.

- The sixth article is most important for the initial foothold:

    *The SOC has been seeing lots of phishing attempts with ods attachements lately. It seems that we’ve got rules in place to detect any run of the mill stuff, including documents that are generated by Metasploit, documents with powershell or cmd invocations.

	 If you see any interesting documents that might get past our yara rules, please drop them in the malware dropbox. I’ve got some automated processing that will see if our rules already identify it, and if not, run it to collect some log data and queue it for further analysis*

### TCP PORT 445(SMB)

- Using smbmap to list shared folders

```bash
:~/CTF/HTB/boxes/RE# smbmap -H 10.10.10.144 -u anonymous
